Splunk-Defensive-Solution-Project
The third project completed during the UT Austin Cybersecurity Bootcamp.

This project was completed with a group of other students. The primary goal was to design a Splunk monitoring solution. After, we used simulated attack logs to test our solution and develop a presentation to show how our solution performed.

Part 1: Designing the Solution
First, we developed reports for the Windows servers and the Apache servers for a fictional web-application. Some of these reports included log signatures, severity levels, Windows successes/failures, HTTP methods, referrer domains, and HTTP response codes.

Using these reports we then developed alerts by determining baselines and thresholds for "unusual" behavior. Finally, we created visual representations and created a functioning dashboard that could be used for real-time monitoring.

Part 2: Testing the Solution
Secondly, we uploaded simulated attack logs in order to test our solution. We then compared reports to see the difference in statistics during a simulated attack. We checked our alerts to determine if they would trigger (or result in too many alerts) and then compared our attack dashboard to the original dashboard.

Finally, using the data received from the attack logs, we developed a hypothesis of what attacks occured and how.

Part 3: Presentation
Below is the presentation created for this project. Here, you'll find detailed information on the development of the solution, simulated attack, and final results.
